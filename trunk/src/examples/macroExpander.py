# macroExpander.py
#
# Example pyparsing program for performing macro expansion, similar to 
# the C pre-processor.  This program is not as fully-featured, simply
# processing macros of the form:
#     #def xxx yyyyy
# and replacing xxx with yyyyy in the rest of the input string.  Macros
# can also be composed using other macros, such as
#     #def zzz xxx+1
# Since xxx was previously defined as yyyyy, then zzz will be replaced
# with yyyyy+1.
