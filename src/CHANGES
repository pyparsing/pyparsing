Change Log
==========

Version 1.4.7 - July, 2007
--------------------------
- NEW NOTATION SHORTCUT: ParserElement now accepts results names using
  a notational shortcut, following the expression with the results name
  in parentheses.  So this:

    stats = "AVE:" + realNum.setResultsName("average") + \
            "MIN:" + realNum.setResultsName("min") + \
            "MAX:" + realNum.setResultsName("max")  

  can now be written as this:
  
    stats = "AVE:" + realNum("average") + \
            "MIN:" + realNum("min") + \
            "MAX:" + realNum("max")  

  The intent behind this change is to make it simpler to define results
  names for significant fields within the expression, while keeping
  the grammar syntax clean and uncluttered.
  
- Fixed bug when packrat parsing is enabled, with cached ParseResults
  being updated by subsequent parsing.  Reported on the pyparsing
  wiki by Kambiz, thanks!

- Fixed bug in operatorPrecedence for unary operators with left
  associativity, if multiple operators were given for the same term.

- Fixed bug in example simpleBool.py, corrected precedence of "and" vs.
  "or" operations.
  
- Fixed bug in Dict class, in which keys were converted to strings
  whether they needed to be or not.  Have narrowed this logic to 
  convert keys to strings only if the keys are ints (which would 
  confuse __getitem__ behavior for list indexing vs. key lookup).

- Added ParserElement method setBreak(), which will invoke the pdb
  module's set_trace() function when this expression is about to be 
  parsed.

- Fixed bug in StringEnd in which reading off the end of the input
  string raises an exception - should match.  Resolved while
  answering a question for Shawn on the pyparsing wiki.
  

Version 1.4.6 - April, 2007
---------------------------
- Simplified constructor for ParseFatalException, to support common
  exception construction idiom:
    raise ParseFatalException, "unexpected text: 'Spanish Inquisition'"

- Added method getTokensEndLoc(), to be called from within a parse action,
  for those parse actions that need both the starting *and* ending 
  location of the parsed tokens within the input text.  

- Enhanced behavior of keepOriginalText so that named parse fields are
  preserved, even though tokens are replaced with the original input
  text matched by the current expression.  Also, cleaned up the stack
  traversal to be more robust.  Suggested by Tim Arnold - thanks, Tim!

- Fixed subtle bug in which countedArray (and similar dynamic 
  expressions configured in parse actions) failed to match within Or,
  Each, FollowedBy, or NotAny.  Reported by Ralf Vosseler, thanks for 
  your patience, Ralf!
  
- Fixed Unicode bug in upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens parse actions,
  scanString, and default debugging actions; reported (and patch submitted)
  by Nikolai Zamkovoi, spasibo!

- Fixed bug when saving a tuple as a named result.  The returned
  token list gave the proper tuple value, but accessing the result by
  name only gave the first element of the tuple.  Reported by 
  Poromenos, nice catch!

- Fixed bug in makeHTMLTags/makeXMLTags, which failed to match tag
  attributes with namespaces.

- Fixed bug in SkipTo when setting include=True, to have the skipped-to
  tokens correctly included in the returned data.  Reported by gunars on 
  the pyparsing wiki, thanks!

- Fixed typobug in OnceOnly.reset method, omitted self argument.
  Submitted by eike welk, thanks for the lint-picking!

- Added performance enhancement to Forward class, suggested by 
  akkartik on the pyparsing Wiki discussion, nice work!

- Added optional asKeyword to Word constructor, to indicate that the
  given word pattern should be matched only as a keyword, that is, it
  should only match if it is within word boundaries.

- Added S-expression parser to examples directory.

- Added macro substitution example to examples directory.

- Added holaMundo.py example, excerpted from Marco Alfonso's blog -
  muchas gracias, Marco!
  
- Modified internal cyclic references in ParseResults to use weakrefs;
  this should help reduce the memory footprint of large parsing 
  programs, at some cost to performance (3-5%). Suggested by bca48150 on
  the pyparsing wiki, thanks!

- Enhanced the documentation describing the vagaries and idiosyncracies
  of parsing strings with embedded tabs, and the impact on:
  . parse actions
  . scanString
  . col and line helper functions
  (Suggested by eike welk in response to some unexplained inconsistencies
  between parsed location and offsets in the input string.)

- Cleaned up internal decorators to preserve function names, 
  docstrings, etc.


Version 1.4.5 - December, 2006
------------------------------
- Removed debugging print statement from QuotedString class.  Sorry
  for not stripping this out before the 1.4.4 release!

- A significant performance improvement, the first one in a while!
  For my Verilog parser, this version of pyparsing is about double the
  speed - YMMV.

- Added support for pickling of ParseResults objects.  (Reported by
  Jeff Poole, thanks Jeff!)

- Fixed minor bug in makeHTMLTags that did not recognize tag attributes
  with embedded '-' or '_' characters.  Also, added support for 
  passing expressions to makeHTMLTags and makeXMLTags, and used this 
  feature to define the globals anyOpenTag and anyCloseTag.
  
- Fixed error in alphas8bit, I had omitted the y-with-umlaut character.

- Added punc8bit string to complement alphas8bit - it contains all the
  non-alphabetic, non-blank 8-bit characters.
  
- Added commonHTMLEntity expression, to match common HTML "ampersand"
  codes, such as "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&nbsp;", and "&quot;".  This
  expression also defines a results name 'entity', which can be used
  to extract the entity field (that is, "lt", "gt", etc.).  Also added
  built-in parse action replaceHTMLEntity, which can be attached to
  commonHTMLEntity to translate "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&nbsp;", and 
  "&quot;" to "<", ">", "&", " ", and "'".

- Added example, htmlStripper.py, that strips HTML tags and scripts
  from HTML pages.  It also translates common HTML entities to their
  respective characters.


Version 1.4.4 - October, 2006
-------------------------------
- Fixed traceParseAction decorator to also trap and record exception
  returns from parse actions, and to handle parse actions with 0,
  1, 2, or 3 arguments.

- Enhanced parse action normalization to support using classes as
  parse actions; that is, the class constructor is called at parse 
  time and the __init__ function is called with 0, 1, 2, or 3 
  arguments.  If passing a class as a parse action, the __init__ 
  method must use one  of the valid parse action parameter list 
  formats. (This technique is useful when using pyparsing to compile 
  parsed text into a series of application objects - see the new 
  example simpleBool.py.)

- Fixed bug in ParseResults when setting an item using an integer
  index. (Reported by Christopher Lambacher, thanks!)

- Fixed whitespace-skipping bug, patch submitted by Paolo Losi -
  grazie, Paolo!

- Fixed bug when a Combine contained an embedded Forward expression,
  reported by cie on the pyparsing wiki - good catch!
  
- Fixed listAllMatches bug, when a listAllMatches result was
  nested within another result. (Reported by don pasquale on 
  comp.lang.python, well done!)

- Fixed bug in ParseResults items() method, when returning an item
  marked as listAllMatches=True

- Fixed bug in definition of cppStyleComment (and javaStyleComment)
  in which '//' line comments were not continued to the next line
  if the line ends with a '\'.  (Reported by eagle-eyed Ralph
  Corderoy!)

- Optimized re's for cppStyleComment and quotedString for better
  re performance - also provided by Ralph Corderoy, thanks!

- Added new example, indentedGrammarExample.py, showing how to 
  define a grammar using indentation to show grouping (as Python
  does for defining statement nesting).  Instigated by an e-mail
  discussion with Andrew Dalke, thanks Andrew!

- Added new helper operatorPrecedence (based on e-mail list discussion
  with Ralph Corderoy and Paolo Losi), to facilitate definition of
  grammars for expressions with unary and binary operators.  For
  instance, this grammar defines a 6-function arithmetic expression
  grammar, with unary plus and minus, proper operator precedence,and 
  right- and left-associativity:
  
    expr = operatorPrecedence( operand,
        [("!", 1, opAssoc.LEFT),
         ("^", 2, opAssoc.RIGHT),
         (oneOf("+ -"), 1, opAssoc.RIGHT),
         (oneOf("* /"), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
         (oneOf("+ -"), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),]
        )

  Also added example simpleArith.py and simpleBool.py to provide
  more detailed code samples using this new helper method.

- Added new helpers matchPreviousLiteral and matchPreviousExpr, for
  creating adaptive parsing expressions that match the same content
  as was parsed in a previous parse expression.  For instance:
  
        first = Word(nums)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + matchPreviousLiteral(first)
  
  will match "1:1", but not "1:2".  Since this matches at the literal
  level, this will also match the leading "1:1" in "1:10".
  
  In contrast:
  
        first = Word(nums)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + matchPreviousExpr(first)
           
  will *not* match the leading "1:1" in "1:10"; the expressions are
  evaluated first, and then compared, so "1" is compared with "10".

- Added keepOriginalText parse action.  Sometimes pyparsing's 
  whitespace-skipping leaves out too much whitespace.  Adding this
  parse action will restore any internal whitespace for a parse
  expression.  This is especially useful when defining expressions
  for scanString or transformString applications.

- Added __add__ method for ParseResults class, to better support
  using Python sum built-in for summing ParseResults objects returned
  from scanString.
  
- Added reset method for the new OnlyOnce class wrapper for parse
  actions (to allow a grammar to be used multiple times).
  
- Added optional maxMatches argument to scanString and searchString,
  to short-circuit scanning after 'n' expression matches are found.


Version 1.4.3 - July, 2006
------------------------------
- Fixed implementation of multiple parse actions for an expression
  (added in 1.4.2).
  . setParseAction() reverts to its previous behavior, setting
    one (or more) actions for an expression, overwriting any
    action or actions previously defined
  . new method addParseAction() appends one or more parse actions
    to the list of parse actions attached to an expression
  Now it is harder to accidentally append parse actions to an
  expression, when what you wanted to do was overwrite whatever had
  been defined before.  (Thanks, Jean-Paul Calderone!)

- Simplified interface to parse actions that do not require all 3
  parse action arguments.  Very rarely do parse actions require more
  than just the parsed tokens, yet parse actions still require all 
  3 arguments including the string being parsed and the location
  within the string where the parse expression was matched.  With this
  release, parse actions may now be defined to be called as:
  . fn(string,locn,tokens)  (the current form)
  . fn(locn,tokens)
  . fn(tokens)
  . fn()
  The setParseAction and addParseAction methods will internally decorate 
  the provided parse actions with compatible wrappers to conform to 
  the full (string,locn,tokens) argument sequence.

- REMOVED SUPPORT FOR RETURNING PARSE LOCATION FROM A PARSE ACTION.
  I announced this in March, 2004, and gave a final warning in the last
  release.  Now you can return a tuple from a parse action, and it will
  be treated like any other return value (i.e., the tuple will be 
  substituted for the incoming tokens passed to the parse action, 
  which is useful when trying to parse strings into tuples).
  
- Added setFailAction method, taking a callable function fn that
  takes the arguments fn(s,loc,expr,err) where:
  . s - string being parsed
  . loc - location where expression match was attempted and failed
  . expr - the parse expression that failed
  . err - the exception thrown
  The function returns no values.  It may throw ParseFatalException
  if it is desired to stop parsing immediately.
  (Suggested by peter21081944 on wikispaces.com)

- Added class OnlyOnce as helper wrapper for parse actions.  OnlyOnce
  only permits a parse action to be called one time, after which
  all subsequent calls throw a ParseException.
  
- Added traceParseAction decorator to help debug parse actions.
  Simply insert "@traceParseAction" ahead of the definition of your
  parse action, and each invocation will be displayed, along with 
  incoming arguments, and returned value.
  
- Fixed bug when copying ParserElements using copy() or 
  setResultsName().  (Reported by Dan Thill, great catch!)
  
- Fixed bug in asXML() where token text contains <, >, and & 
  characters - generated XML now escapes these as &lt;, &gt; and
  &amp;.  (Reported by Jacek Sieka, thanks!)
  
- Fixed bug in SkipTo() when searching for a StringEnd(). (Reported 
  by Pete McEvoy, thanks Pete!)
  
- Fixed "except Exception" statements, the most critical added as part
  of the packrat parsing enhancement.  (Thanks, Erick Tryzelaar!)
  
- Fixed end-of-string infinite looping on LineEnd and StringEnd 
  expressions.  (Thanks again to Erick Tryzelaar.)
  
- Modified setWhitespaceChars to return self, to be consistent with
  other ParserElement modifiers. (Suggested by Erick Tryzelaar.)

- Fixed bug/typo in new ParseResults.dump() method.

- Fixed bug in searchString() method, in which only the first token of
  an expression was returned.  searchString() now returns a 
  ParseResults collection of all search matches.

- Added example program removeLineBreaks.py, a string transformer that 
  converts text files with hard line-breaks into one with line breaks
  only between paragraphs.
  
- Added example program listAllMatches.py, to illustrate using the
  listAllMatches option when specifying results names (also shows new
  support for passing lists to oneOf).

- Added example program linenoExample.py, to illustrate using the
  helper methods lineno, line, and col, and returning objects from a
  parse action.

- Added example program parseListString.py, to which can parse the
  string representation of a Python list back into a true list.  Taken
  mostly from my PyCon presentation examples, but now with support 
  for tuple elements, too!



Version 1.4.2 - April 1, 2006 (No foolin'!)
-------------------------------------------
- Significant speedup from memoizing nested expressions (a technique 
  known as "packrat parsing"), thanks to Chris Lesniewski-Laas!  Your 
  mileage may vary, but my Verilog parser almost doubled in speed to 
  over 600 lines/sec!
  
  This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that 
  have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when
  you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your
  program must call the class method ParserElement.enablePackrat().  If
  your program uses psyco to "compile as you go", you must call 
  enablePackrat before calling psyco.full().  If you do not do this,
  Python will crash.  For best results, call enablePackrat() immediately
  after importing pyparsing.

- Added new helper method countedArray(expr), for defining patterns that
  start with a leading integer to indicate the number of array elements, 
  followed by that many elements, matching the given expr parse 
  expression.  For instance, this two-liner:
    wordArray = countedArray(Word(alphas))
    print wordArray.parseString("3 Practicality beats purity")[0]
  returns the parsed array of words:
    ['Practicality', 'beats', 'purity']
  The leading token '3' is suppressed, although it is easily obtained
  from the length of the returned array.
  (Inspired by e-mail discussion with Ralf Vosseler.)

- Added support for attaching multiple parse actions to a single 
  ParserElement. (Suggested by Dan "Dang" Griffith - nice idea, Dan!)

- Added support for asymmetric quoting characters in the recently-added
  QuotedString class.  Now you can define your own quoted string syntax
  like "<<This is a string in double angle brackets.>>".  To define
  this custom form of QuotedString, your code would define:
    dblAngleQuotedString = QuotedString('<<',endQuoteChar='>>')
  QuotedString also supports escaped quotes, escape character other 
  than '\', and multiline.

- Changed the default value returned internally by Optional, so that
  None can be used as a default value.  (Suggested by Steven Bethard - 
  I finally saw the light!)

- Added dump() method to ParseResults, to make it easier to list out
  and diagnose values returned from calling parseString.

- A new example, a search query string parser, submitted by Steven 
  Mooij and Rudolph Froger - a very interesting application, thanks!

- Added an example that parses the BNF in Python's Grammar file, in 
  support of generating Python grammar documentation. (Suggested by
  J H Stovall.)
  
- A new example, submitted by Tim Cera, of a flexible parser module,
  using a simple config variable to adjust parsing for input formats
  that have slight variations - thanks, Tim!
  
- Added an example for parsing Roman numerals, showing the capability
  of parse actions to "compile" Roman numerals into their integer
  values during parsing.

- Added a new docs directory, for additional documentation or help.
  Currently, this includes the text and examples from my recent
  presentation at PyCon.
  
- Fixed another typo in CaselessKeyword, thanks Stefan Behnel.

- Expanded oneOf to also accept tuples, not just lists.  This really 
  should be sufficient...

- Added deprecation warnings when tuple is returned from a parse action.
  Looking back, I see that I originally deprecated this feature in March,
  2004, so I'm guessing people really shouldn't have been using this 
  feature - I'll drop it altogether in the next release, which will 
  allow users to return a tuple from a parse action (which is really 
  handy when trying to reconstuct tuples from a tuple string 
  representation!).


Version 1.4.1 - February, 2006
------------------------------
- Converted generator expression in QuotedString class to list 
  comprehension, to retain compatibility with Python 2.3. (Thanks, Titus 
  Brown for the heads-up!)

- Added searchString() method to ParserElement, as an alternative to
  using "scanString(instring).next()[0][0]" to search through a string 
  looking for a substring matching a given parse expression. (Inspired by
  e-mail conversation with Dave Feustel.)

- Modified oneOf to accept lists of strings as well as a single string
  of space-delimited literals.  (Suggested by Jacek Sieka - thanks!)

- Removed deprecated use of Upcase in pyparsing test code. (Also caught by
  Titus Brown.)

- Removed lstrip() call from Literal - too aggressive in stripping
  whitespace which may be valid for some grammars.  (Point raised by Jacek 
  Sieka).  Also, made Literal more robust in the event of passing an empty 
  string.
  
- Fixed bug in replaceWith when returning None.

- Added cautionary documentation for Forward class when assigning a
  MatchFirst expression, as in:
    fwdExpr << a | b | c
  Precedence of operators causes this to be evaluated as:
    (fwdExpr << a) | b | c
  thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  Users must
  explicitly group the values inserted into the Forward:
    fwdExpr << (a | b | c)
  (Suggested by Scot Wilcoxon - thanks, Scot!)
  
  
Version 1.4 - January 18, 2006
------------------------------
- Added Regex class, to permit definition of complex embedded expressions 
  using regular expressions. (Enhancement provided by John Beisley, great 
  job!)

- Converted implementations of Word, oneOf, quoted string, and comment 
  helpers to utilize regular expression matching.  Performance improvements 
  in the 20-40% range.

- Added QuotedString class, to support definition of non-standard quoted 
  strings (Suggested by Guillaume Proulx, thanks!)
  
- Added CaselessKeyword class, to streamline grammars with, well, caseless 
  keywords (Proposed by Stefan Behnel, thanks!)
  
- Fixed bug in SkipTo, when using an ignoreable expression. (Patch provided 
  by Anonymous, thanks, whoever-you-are!)
  
- Fixed typo in NoMatch class. (Good catch, Stefan Behnel!)

- Fixed minor bug in _makeTags(), using string.printables instead of 
  pyparsing.printables.

- Cleaned up some of the expressions created by makeXXXTags helpers, to 
  suppress extraneous <> characters.
  
- Added some grammar definition-time checking to verify that a grammar is 
  being built using proper ParserElements.
  
- Added examples:
  . LAparser.py - linear algebra C preprocessor (submitted by Mike Ellis, 
    thanks Mike!)
  . wordsToNum.py - converts word description of a number back to 
    the original number (such as 'one hundred and twenty three' -> 123)
  . updated fourFn.py to support unary minus, added BNF comments


Version 1.3.3 - September 12, 2005
----------------------------------
- Improved support for Unicode strings that would be returned using
  srange.  Added greetingInKorean.py example, for a Korean version of
  "Hello, World!" using Unicode. (Thanks, June Kim!)

- Added 'hexnums' string constant (nums+"ABCDEFabcdef") for defining 
  hexadecimal value expressions.
  
- NOTE: ===THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE===
  Modified tag and results definitions returned by makeHTMLTags(),
  to better support the looseness of HTML parsing.  Tags to be 
  parsed are now caseless, and keys generated for tag attributes are 
  now converted to lower case.
  
  Formerly, makeXMLTags("XYZ") would return a tag with results 
  name of "startXYZ", this has been changed to "startXyz".  If this
  tag is matched against '<XYZ Abc="1" DEF="2" ghi="3">', the 
  matched keys formerly would be "Abc", "DEF", and "ghi"; keys are
  now converted to lower case, giving keys of "abc", "def", and 
  "ghi".  These changes were made to try to address the lax
  case sensitivity agreement between start and end tags in many 
  HTML pages.
  
  No changes were made to makeXMLTags(), which assumes more rigorous 
  parsing rules.
  
  Also, cleaned up case-sensitivity bugs in closing tags, and 
  switched to using Keyword instead of Literal class for tags.
  (Thanks, Steve Young, for getting me to look at these in more
  detail!)

- Added two helper parse actions, upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens,
  which will convert matched text to all uppercase or lowercase,
  respectively.

- Deprecated Upcase class, to be replaced by upcaseTokens parse 
  action.
  
- Converted messages sent to stderr to use warnings module, such as 
  when constructing a Literal with an empty string, one should use 
  the Empty() class or the empty helper instead.

- Added ' ' (space) as an escapable character within a quoted
  string.

- Added helper expressions for common comment types, in addition
  to the existing cStyleComment (/*...*/) and htmlStyleComment
  (<!-- ... -->)
  . dblSlashComment = // ... (to end of line)
  . cppStyleComment = cStyleComment or dblSlashComment
  . javaStyleComment = cppStyleComment
  . pythonStyleComment = # ... (to end of line)


  
Version 1.3.2 - July 24, 2005
-----------------------------
- Added Each class as an enhanced version of And.  'Each' requires 
  that all given expressions be present, but may occur in any order.  
  Special handling is provided to group ZeroOrMore and OneOrMore 
  elements that occur out-of-order in the input string.  You can also 
  construct 'Each' objects by joining expressions with the '&' 
  operator.  When using the Each class, results names are strongly 
  recommended for accessing the matched tokens. (Suggested by Pradam 
  Amini - thanks, Pradam!)
  
- Stricter interpretation of 'max' qualifier on Word elements.  If the 
  'max' attribute is specified, matching will fail if an input field 
  contains more than 'max' consecutive body characters.  For example, 
  previously, Word(nums,max=3) would match the first three characters 
  of '0123456', returning '012' and continuing parsing at '3'.  Now, 
  when constructed using the max attribute, Word will raise an 
  exception with this string.

- Cleaner handling of nested dictionaries returned by Dict.  No
  longer necessary to dereference sub-dictionaries as element [0] of
  their parents. 
  === NOTE: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK SOME EXISTING CODE, BUT ONLY IF 
  PARSING NESTED DICTIONARIES USING THE LITTLE-USED DICT CLASS ===
  (Prompted by discussion thread on the Python Tutor list, with
  contributions from Danny Yoo, Kent Johnson, and original post by
  Liam Clarke - thanks all!)
  


Version 1.3.1 - June, 2005
----------------------------------
- Added markInputline() method to ParseException, to display the input
  text line location of the parsing exception. (Thanks, Stefan Behnel!)
  
- Added setDefaultKeywordChars(), so that Keyword definitions using a 
  custom keyword character set do not all need to add the keywordChars
  constructor argument (similar to setDefaultWhitespaceChars()). 
  (suggested by rzhanka on the SourceForge pyparsing forum.)
  
- Simplified passing debug actions to setDebugAction().  You can now
  pass 'None' for a debug action if you want to take the default 
  debug behavior.  To suppress a particular debug action, you can pass
  the pyparsing method nullDebugAction.
  
- Refactored parse exception classes, moved all behavior to 
  ParseBaseException, and the former ParseException is now a subclass of
  ParseBaseException.  Added a second subclass, ParseFatalException, as
  a subclass of ParseBaseException.  User-defined parse actions can raise
  ParseFatalException if a data inconsistency is detected (such as a 
  begin-tag/end-tag mismatch), and this will stop all parsing immediately.
  (Inspired by e-mail thread with Michele Petrazzo - thanks, Michelle!)
  
- Added helper methods makeXMLTags and makeHTMLTags, that simplify the
  definition of XML or HTML tag parse expressions for a given tagname.  
  Both functions return a pair of parse expressions, one for the opening 
  tag (that is, '<tagname>') and one for the closing tag ('</tagname>').
  The opening tagame also recognizes any attribute definitions that have
  been included in the opening tag, as well as an empty tag (one with a
  trailing '/', as in '<BODY/>' which is equivalent to '<BODY></BODY>').
  makeXMLTags uses stricter XML syntax for attributes, requiring that they
  be enclosed in double quote characters - makeHTMLTags is more lenient, 
  and accepts single-quoted strings or any contiguous string of characters
  up to the next whitespace character or '>' character.  Attributes can
  be retrieved as dictionary or attribute values of the returned results
  from the opening tag.

- Added example minimath2.py, a refinement on fourFn.py that adds
  an interactive session and support for variables.  (Thanks, Steven Siew!)
  
- Added performance improvement, up to 20% reduction!  (Found while working
  with Wolfgang Borgert on performance tuning of his TTCN3 parser.)
  
- And another performance improvement, up to 25%, when using scanString!
  (Found while working with Henrik Westlund on his C header file scanner.)
  
- Updated UML diagrams to reflect latest class/method changes.


Version 1.3 - March, 2005
----------------------------------
- Added new Keyword class, as a special form of Literal.  Keywords
  must be followed by whitespace or other non-keyword characters, to
  distinguish them from variables or other identifiers that just
  happen to start with the same characters as a keyword.  For instance,
  the input string containing "ifOnlyIfOnly" will match a Literal("if")
  at the beginning and in the middle, but will fail to match a 
  Keyword("if").  Keyword("if") will match only strings such as "if only" 
  or "if(only)". (Proposed by Wolfgang Borgert, and Berteun Damman 
  separately requested this on comp.lang.python - great idea!)

- Added setWhitespaceChars() method to override the characters to be 
  skipped as whitespace before matching a particular ParseElement.  Also
  added the class-level method setDefaultWhitespaceChars(), to allow
  users to override the default set of whitespace characters (space,
  tab, newline, and return) for all subsequently defined ParseElements.
  (Inspired by Klaas Hofstra's inquiry on the Sourceforge pyparsing
  forum.)
  
- Added helper parse actions to support some very common parse 
  action use cases:
  . replaceWith(replStr) - replaces the matching tokens with the 
    provided replStr replacement string; especially useful with 
    transformString()
  . removeQuotes - removes first and last character from string enclosed
    in quotes (note - NOT the same as the string strip() method, as only
    a single character is removed at each end)
    
- Added copy() method to ParseElement, to make it easier to define 
  different parse actions for the same basic parse expression.  (Note, copy
  is implicitly called when using setResultsName().)


  (The following changes were posted to CVS as Version 1.2.3 - 
  October-December, 2004)
  
- Added support for Unicode strings in creating grammar definitions.  
  (Big thanks to Gavin Panella!)

- Added constant alphas8bit to include the following 8-bit characters:
    ¿¡¬√ƒ≈∆«»… ÀÃÕŒœ–—“”‘’÷ÿŸ⁄€‹›ﬁﬂ‡·‚„‰ÂÊÁËÈÍÎÏÌÓÔÒÚÛÙıˆ¯˘˙˚¸˝˛
  
- Added srange() function to simplify definition of Word elements, using 
  regexp-like '[A-Za-z0-9]' syntax.  This also simplifies referencing
  common 8-bit characters.
  
- Fixed bug in Dict when a single element Dict was embedded within another
  Dict. (Thanks Andy Yates for catching this one!)
  
- Added 'formatted' argument to ParseResults.asXML().  If set to False,
  suppresses insertion of whitespace for pretty-print formatting.  Default
  equals True for backward compatibility.
  
- Added setDebugActions() function to ParserElement, to allow user-defined
  debugging actions.

- Added support for escaped quotes (either in \', \", or doubled quote 
  form) to the predefined expressions for quoted strings. (Thanks, Ero
  Carrera!)
  
- Minor performance improvement (~5%) converting "char in string" tests
  to "char in dict". (Suggested by Gavin Panella, cool idea!)
  

Version 1.2.2 - September 27, 2004
----------------------------------
- Modified delimitedList to accept an expression as the delimiter, instead
  of only accepting strings.
  
- Modified ParseResults, to convert integer field keys to strings (to 
  avoid confusion with list access).

- Modified Combine, to convert all embedded tokens to strings before
  combining.
  
- Fixed bug in MatchFirst in which parse actions would be called for 
  expressions that only partially match. (Thanks, John Hunter!)
  
- Fixed bug in fourFn.py example that fixes right-associativity of ^ 
  operator. (Thanks, Andrea Griffini!)

- Added class FollowedBy(expression), to look ahead in the input string 
  without consuming tokens.

- Added class NoMatch that never matches any input. Can be useful in
  debugging, and in very specialized grammars.
  
- Added example pgn.py, for parsing chess game files stored in Portable
  Game Notation. (Thanks, Alberto Santini!)


Version 1.2.1 - August 19, 2004
-------------------------------
- Added SkipTo(expression) token type, simplifying grammars that only
  want to specify delimiting expressions, and want to match any characters
  between them.
  
- Added helper method dictOf(key,value), making it easier to work with
  the Dict class. (Inspired by Pavel Volkovitskiy, thanks!).

- Added optional argument listAllMatches (default=False) to 
  setResultsName().  Setting listAllMatches to True overrides the default
  modal setting of tokens to results names; instead, the results name
  acts as an accumulator for all matching tokens within the local 
  repetition group. (Suggested by Amaury Le Leyzour - thanks!)
  
- Fixed bug in ParseResults, throwing exception when trying to extract
  slice, or make a copy using [:]. (Thanks, Wilson Fowlie!)
  
- Fixed bug in transformString() when the input string contains <TAB>'s
  (Thanks, Rick Walia!).
  
- Fixed bug in returning tokens from un-Grouped And's, Or's and 
  MatchFirst's, where too many tokens would be included in the results, 
  confounding parse actions and returned results.
  
- Fixed bug in naming ParseResults returned by And's, Or's, and Match
  First's.

- Fixed bug in LineEnd() - matching this token now correctly consumes
  and returns the end of line "\n".
  
- Added a beautiful example for parsing Mozilla calendar files (Thanks, 
  Petri Savolainen!).

- Added support for dynamically modifying Forward expressions during
  parsing.


Version 1.2 - 20 June 2004
--------------------------
- Added definition for htmlComment to help support HTML scanning and
  parsing.
  
- Fixed bug in generating XML for Dict classes, in which trailing item was
  duplicated in the output XML.

- Fixed release bug in which scanExamples.py was omitted from release
  files.

- Fixed bug in transformString() when parse actions are not defined on the
  outermost parser element.

- Added example urlExtractor.py, as another example of using scanString
  and parse actions.
  

Version 1.2beta3 - 4 June 2004
------------------------------
- Added White() token type, analogous to Word, to match on whitespace
  characters.  Use White in parsers with significant whitespace (such as 
  configuration file parsers that use indentation to indicate grouping).  
  Construct White with a string containing the whitespace characters to be 
  matched.  Similar to Word, White also takes optional min, max, and exact 
  parameters. 

- As part of supporting whitespace-signficant parsing, added parseWithTabs() 
  method to ParserElement, to override the default behavior in parseString
  of automatically expanding tabs to spaces.  To retain tabs during
  parsing, call parseWithTabs() before calling parseString(), parseFile() or 
  scanString(). (Thanks, Jean-Guillaume Paradis for catching this, and for
  your suggestions on whitespace-significant parsing.)
  
- Added transformString() method to ParseElement, as a complement to 
  scanString().  To use transformString, define a grammar and attach a parse
  action to the overall grammar that modifies the returned token list.  
  Invoking transformString() on a target string will then scan for matches, 
  and replace the matched text patterns according to the logic in the parse 
  action.  transformString() returns the resulting transformed string.
  (Note: transformString() does *not* automatically expand tabs to spaces.)
  Also added scanExamples.py to the examples directory to show sample uses of
  scanString() and transformString().
  
- Removed group() method that was introduced in beta2.  This turns out NOT to
  be equivalent to nesting within a Group() object, and I'd prefer not to sow
  more seeds of confusion.
  
- Fixed behavior of asXML() where tags for groups were incorrectly duplicated.
  (Thanks, Brad Clements!)
  
- Changed beta version message to display to stderr instead of stdout, to 
  make asXML() easier to use.  (Thanks again, Brad.)


Version 1.2beta2 - 19 May 2004
------------------------------
- *** SIMPLIFIED API *** - Parse actions that do not modify the list of tokens
  no longer need to return a value.  This simplifies those parse actions that
  use the list of tokens to update a counter or record or display some of the
  token content; these parse actions can simply end without having to specify
  'return toks'.

- *** POSSIBLE API INCOMPATIBILITY *** - Fixed CaselessLiteral bug, where the 
  returned token text was not the original string (as stated in the docs), 
  but the original string converted to upper case.  (Thanks, Dang Griffith!)  
  **NOTE: this may break some code that relied on this erroneous behavior.
  Users should scan their code for uses of CaselessLiteral.**

- *** POSSIBLE CODE INCOMPATIBILITY *** - I have renamed the internal 
  attributes on ParseResults from 'dict' and 'list' to '__tokdict' and 
  '__toklist', to avoid collisions with user-defined data fields named 'dict'
  and 'list'.  Any client code that accesses these attributes directly will
  need to be modified.  Hopefully the implementation of methods such as keys(),
  items(), len(), etc. on ParseResults will make such direct attribute
  accessess unnecessary.
  
- Added asXML() method to ParseResults.  This greatly simplifies the process 
  of parsing an input data file and generating XML-structured data.

- Added getName() method to ParseResults.  This method is helpful when
  a grammar specifies ZeroOrMore or OneOrMore of a MatchFirst or Or
  expression, and the parsing code needs to know which expression matched.
  (Thanks, Eric van der Vlist, for this idea!)
  
- Added items() and values() methods to ParseResults, to better support using
  ParseResults as a Dictionary.

- Added parseFile() as a convenience function to parse the contents of an 
  entire text file.  Accepts either a file name or a file object.  (Thanks
  again, Dang!)

- Added group() method to And, Or, and MatchFirst, as a short-cut alternative
  to enclosing a construct inside a Group object.
  
- Extended fourFn.py to support exponentiation, and simple built-in functions.

- Added EBNF parser to examples, including a demo where it parses its own
  EBNF!  (Thanks to Seo Sanghyeon!)
  
- Added Delphi Form parser to examples, dfmparse.py, plus a couple of
  sample Delphi forms as tests.  (Well done, Dang!)

- Another performance speedup, 5-10%, inspired by Dang!  Plus about a 20%
  speedup, by pre-constructing and cacheing exception objects instead of 
  constructing them on the fly.

- Fixed minor bug when specifying oneOf() with 'caseless=True'.

- Cleaned up and added a few more docstrings, to improve the generated docs.


Version 1.1.2 - 21 Mar 2004
---------------------------
- Fixed minor bug in scanString(), so that start location is at the start of 
  the matched tokens, not at the start of the whitespace before the matched 
  tokens.

- Inclusion of HTML documentation, generated using Epydoc.  Reformatted some
  doc strings to better generate readable docs. (Beautiful work, Ed Loper,
  thanks for Epydoc!)

- Minor performance speedup, 5-15%

- And on a process note, I've used the unittest module to define a series of
  unit tests, to help avoid the embarrassment of the version 1.1 snafu.
  

Version 1.1.1 - 6 Mar 2004
--------------------------
- Fixed critical bug introduced in 1.1, which broke MatchFirst(!) token 
  matching.
  **THANK YOU, SEO SANGHYEON!!!**
  
- Added "from future import __generators__" to permit running under 
  pre-Python 2.3.

- Added example getNTPservers.py, showing how to use pyparsing to extract
  a text pattern from the HTML of a web page.
  
  
Version 1.1 - 3 Mar 2004
-------------------------
- ***Changed API*** - While testing out parse actions, I found that the value 
  of loc passed in was not the starting location of the matched tokens, but
  the location of the next token in the list.  With this version, the location
  passed to the parse action is now the starting location of the tokens that
  matched.
  
  A second part of this change is that the return value of parse actions no 
  longer needs to return a tuple containing both the location and the parsed
  tokens (which may optionally be modified); parse actions only need to return
  the list of tokens.  Parse actions that return a tuple are deprecated; they 
  will still work properly for conversion/compatibility, but this behavior will 
  be removed in a future version.
  
- Added validate() method, to help diagnose infinite recursion in a grammar tree.
  validate() is not 100% fool-proof, but it can help track down nasty infinite
  looping due to recursively referencing the same grammar construct without some 
  intervening characters.

- Cleaned up default listing of some parse element types, to more closely match
  ordinary BNF.  Instead of the form <classname>:[contents-list], some changes 
  are:
  . And(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 token2 token3 }"
  . Or(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 ^ token2 ^ token3 }"
  . MatchFirst(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 | token2 | token3 }"
  . Optional(token) is "[ token ]"
  . OneOrMore(token) is "{ token }..."
  . ZeroOrMore(token) is "[ token ]..."
  
- Fixed an infinite loop in oneOf if the input string contains a duplicated
  option. (Thanks Brad Clements)

- Fixed a bug when specifying a results name on an Optional token. (Thanks 
  again, Brad Clements)
  
- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.6 when I converted quotedString to use
  CharsNotIn; I accidentally permitted quoted strings to span newlines.  I have
  fixed this in this version to go back to the original behavior, in which
  quoted strings do *not* span newlines.

- Fixed minor bug in HTTP server log parser. (Thanks Jim Richardson)


Version 1.0.6 -  13 Feb 2004
----------------------------
- Added CharsNotIn class (Thanks, Lee SangYeong).  This is the opposite of 
  Word, in that it is constructed with a set of characters *not* to be matched.
  (This enhancement also allowed me to clean up and simplify some of the
  definitions for quoted strings, cStyleComment, and restOfLine.)
  
- **MINOR API CHANGE** - Added joinString argument to the __init__ method of 
  Combine (Thanks, Thomas Kalka).  joinString defaults to "", but some 
  applications might choose some other string to use instead, such as a blank 
  or newline.  joinString was inserted as the second argument to __init__,
  so if you have code that specifies an adjacent value, without using
  'adjacent=', this code will break.

- Modified LineStart to recognize the start of an empty line.

- Added optional caseless flag to oneOf(), to create a list of CaselessLiteral
  tokens instead of Literal tokens.

- Added some enhancements to the SQL example:
  . Oracle-style comments (Thanks to Harald Armin Massa)
  . simple WHERE clause

- Minor performance speedup - 5-15%


Version 1.0.5 -  19 Jan 2004
----------------------------
- Added scanString() generator method to ParseElement, to support regex-like
  pattern-searching

- Added items() list to ParseResults, to return named results as a 
  list of (key,value) pairs
  
- Fixed memory overflow in asList() for deeply nested ParseResults (Thanks,
  Sverrir Valgeirsson)

- Minor performance speedup - 10-15%


Version 1.0.4 -  8 Jan 2004
---------------------------
- Added positional tokens StringStart, StringEnd, LineStart, and LineEnd

- Added commaSeparatedList to pre-defined global token definitions; also added 
  commasep.py to the examples directory, to demonstrate the differences between 
  parsing comma-separated data and simple line-splitting at commas

- Minor API change: delimitedList does not automatically enclose the
  list elements in a Group, but makes this the responsibility of the caller;
  also, if invoked using 'combine=True', the list delimiters are also included
  in the returned text (good for scoped variables, such as a.b.c or a::b::c, or
  for directory paths such as a/b/c)
  
- Performance speed-up again, 30-40%

- Added httpServerLogParser.py to examples directory, as this is
  a common parsing task
  

Version 1.0.3 - 23 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Performance speed-up again, 20-40%

- Added Python distutils installation setup.py, etc. (thanks, Dave Kuhlman)


Version 1.0.2 - 18 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE: Changed API again!!!** (for the last time, I hope)
  
  + Renamed module from parsing to pyparsing, to better reflect Python
    linkage.

- Also added dictExample.py to examples directory, to illustrate
  usage of the Dict class.


Version 1.0.1 - 17 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE:  Changed API!**
  
  + Renamed 'len' argument on Word.__init__() to 'exact'

- Performance speed-up, 10-30%


Version 1.0.0 - 15 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Initial public release

Version 0.1.1 thru 0.1.17 - October-November, 2003
--------------------------------------------------
- initial development iterations:
    - added Dict, Group
    - added helper methods oneOf, delimitedList
    - added helpers quotedString (and double and single), restOfLine, cStyleComment
    - added MatchFirst as an alternative to the slower Or
    - added UML class diagram
    - fixed various logic bugs
