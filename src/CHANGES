Change Log
==========

Version 1.3.3 - September 12, 2005
----------------------------------
- Improved support for Unicode strings that would be returned using
  srange.  Added greetingInKorean.py example, for a Korean version of
  "Hello, World!" using Unicode. (Thanks, June Kim!)

- Added 'hexnums' string constant (nums+"ABCDEFabcdef") for defining 
  hexadecimal value expressions.
  
- NOTE: ===THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE===
  Modified tag and results definitions returned by makeHTMLTags(),
  to better support the looseness of HTML parsing.  Tags to be 
  parsed are now caseless, and keys generated for tag attributes are 
  now converted to lower case.
  
  Formerly, makeXMLTags("XYZ") would return a tag with results 
  name of "startXYZ", this has been changed to "startXyz".  If this
  tag is matched against '<XYZ Abc="1" DEF="2" ghi="3">', the 
  matched keys formerly would be "Abc", "DEF", and "ghi"; keys are
  now converted to lower case, giving keys of "abc", "def", and 
  "ghi".  These changes were made to try to address the lax
  case sensitivity agreement between start and end tags in many 
  HTML pages.
  
  No changes were made to makeXMLTags(), which assumes more rigorous 
  parsing rules.
  
  Also, cleaned up case-sensitivity bugs in closing tags, and 
  switched to using Keyword instead of Literal class for tags.
  (Thanks, Steve Young, for getting me to look at these in more
  detail!)

- Added two helper parse actions, upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens,
  which will convert matched text to all uppercase or lowercase,
  respectively.

- Deprecated Upcase class, to be replaced by upcaseTokens parse 
  action.
  
- Converted messages sent to stderr to use warnings module, such as 
  when constructing a Literal with an empty string, one should use 
  the Empty() class or the empty helper instead.

- Added ' ' (space) as an escapable character within a quoted
  string.

- Added helper expressions for common comment types, in addition
  to the existing cStyleComment (/*...*/) and htmlStyleComment
  (<!-- ... -->)
  . dblSlashComment = // ... (to end of line)
  . cppStyleComment = cStyleComment or dblSlashComment
  . javaStyleComment = cppStyleComment
  . pythonStyleComment = # ... (to end of line)


  
Version 1.3.2 - July 24, 2005
-----------------------------
- Added Each class as an enhanced version of And.  'Each' requires 
  that all given expressions be present, but may occur in any order.  
  Special handling is provided to group ZeroOrMore and OneOrMore 
  elements that occur out-of-order in the input string.  You can also 
  construct 'Each' objects by joining expressions with the '&' 
  operator.  When using the Each class, results names are strongly 
  recommended for accessing the matched tokens. (Suggested by Pradam 
  Amini - thanks, Pradam!)
  
- Stricter interpretation of 'max' qualifier on Word elements.  If the 
  'max' attribute is specified, matching will fail if an input field 
  contains more than 'max' consecutive body characters.  For example, 
  previously, Word(nums,max=3) would match the first three characters 
  of '0123456', returning '012' and continuing parsing at '3'.  Now, 
  when constructed using the max attribute, Word will raise an 
  exception with this string.

- Cleaner handling of nested dictionaries returned by Dict.  No
  longer necessary to dereference sub-dictionaries as element [0] of
  their parents. 
  === NOTE: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK SOME EXISTING CODE, BUT ONLY IF 
  PARSING NESTED DICTIONARIES USING THE LITTLE-USED DICT CLASS ===
  (Prompted by discussion thread on the Python Tutor list, with
  contributions from Danny Yoo, Kent Johnson, and original post by
  Liam Clarke - thanks all!)
  


Version 1.3.1 - June, 2005
----------------------------------
- Added markInputline() method to ParseException, to display the input
  text line location of the parsing exception. (Thanks, Stefan Behnel!)
  
- Added setDefaultKeywordChars(), so that Keyword definitions using a 
  custom keyword character set do not all need to add the keywordChars
  constructor argument (similar to setDefaultWhitespaceChars()). 
  (suggested by rzhanka on the SourceForge pyparsing forum.)
  
- Simplified passing debug actions to setDebugAction().  You can now
  pass 'None' for a debug action if you want to take the default 
  debug behavior.  To suppress a particular debug action, you can pass
  the pyparsing method nullDebugAction.
  
- Refactored parse exception classes, moved all behavior to 
  ParseBaseException, and the former ParseException is now a subclass of
  ParseBaseException.  Added a second subclass, ParseFatalException, as
  a subclass of ParseBaseException.  User-defined parse actions can raise
  ParseFatalException if a data inconsistency is detected (such as a 
  begin-tag/end-tag mismatch), and this will stop all parsing immediately.
  (Inspired by e-mail thread with Michele Petrazzo - thanks, Michelle!)
  
- Added helper methods makeXMLTags and makeHTMLTags, that simplify the
  definition of XML or HTML tag parse expressions for a given tagname.  
  Both functions return a pair of parse expressions, one for the opening 
  tag (that is, '<tagname>') and one for the closing tag ('</tagname>').
  The opening tagame also recognizes any attribute definitions that have
  been included in the opening tag, as well as an empty tag (one with a
  trailing '/', as in '<BODY/>' which is equivalent to '<BODY></BODY>').
  makeXMLTags uses stricter XML syntax for attributes, requiring that they
  be enclosed in double quote characters - makeHTMLTags is more lenient, 
  and accepts single-quoted strings or any contiguous string of characters
  up to the next whitespace character or '>' character.  Attributes can
  be retrieved as dictionary or attribute values of the returned results
  from the opening tag.

- Added example minimath2.py, a refinement on fourFn.py that adds
  an interactive session and support for variables.  (Thanks, Steven Siew!)
  
- Added performance improvement, up to 20% reduction!  (Found while working
  with Wolfgang Borgert on performance tuning of his TTCN3 parser.)
  
- And another performance improvement, up to 25%, when using scanString!
  (Found while working with Henrik Westlund on his C header file scanner.)
  
- Updated UML diagrams to reflect latest class/method changes.


Version 1.3 - March, 2005
----------------------------------
- Added new Keyword class, as a special form of Literal.  Keywords
  must be followed by whitespace or other non-keyword characters, to
  distinguish them from variables or other identifiers that just
  happen to start with the same characters as a keyword.  For instance,
  the input string containing "ifOnlyIfOnly" will match a Literal("if")
  at the beginning and in the middle, but will fail to match a 
  Keyword("if").  Keyword("if") will match only strings such as "if only" 
  or "if(only)". (Proposed by Wolfgang Borgert, and Berteun Damman 
  separately requested this on comp.lang.python - great idea!)

- Added setWhitespaceChars() method to override the characters to be 
  skipped as whitespace before matching a particular ParseElement.  Also
  added the class-level method setDefaultWhitespaceChars(), to allow
  users to override the default set of whitespace characters (space,
  tab, newline, and return) for all subsequently defined ParseElements.
  (Inspired by Klaas Hofstra's inquiry on the Sourceforge pyparsing
  forum.)
  
- Added helper parse actions to support some very common parse 
  action use cases:
  . replaceWith(replStr) - replaces the matching tokens with the 
    provided replStr replacement string; especially useful with 
    transformString()
  . removeQuotes - removes first and last character from string enclosed
    in quotes (note - NOT the same as the string strip() method, as only
    a single character is removed at each end)
    
- Added copy() method to ParseElement, to make it easier to define 
  different parse actions for the same basic parse expression.  (Note, copy
  is implicitly called when using setResultsName().)


  (The following changes were posted to CVS as Version 1.2.3 - 
  October-December, 2004)
  
- Added support for Unicode strings in creating grammar definitions.  
  (Big thanks to Gavin Panella!)

- Added constant alphas8bit to include the following 8-bit characters:
    ¿¡¬√ƒ≈∆«»… ÀÃÕŒœ–—“”‘’÷ÿŸ⁄€‹›ﬁﬂ‡·‚„‰ÂÊÁËÈÍÎÏÌÓÔÒÚÛÙıˆ¯˘˙˚¸˝˛
  
- Added srange() function to simplify definition of Word elements, using 
  regexp-like '[A-Za-z0-9]' syntax.  This also simplifies referencing
  common 8-bit characters.
  
- Fixed bug in Dict when a single element Dict was embedded within another
  Dict. (Thanks Andy Yates for catching this one!)
  
- Added 'formatted' argument to ParseResults.asXML().  If set to False,
  suppresses insertion of whitespace for pretty-print formatting.  Default
  equals True for backward compatibility.
  
- Added setDebugActions() function to ParserElement, to allow user-defined
  debugging actions.

- Added support for escaped quotes (either in \', \", or doubled quote 
  form) to the predefined expressions for quoted strings. (Thanks, Ero
  Carrera!)
  
- Minor performance improvement (~5%) converting "char in string" tests
  to "char in dict". (Suggested by Gavin Panella, cool idea!)
  

Version 1.2.2 - September 27, 2004
----------------------------------
- Modified delimitedList to accept an expression as the delimiter, instead
  of only accepting strings.
  
- Modified ParseResults, to convert integer field keys to strings (to 
  avoid confusion with list access).

- Modified Combine, to convert all embedded tokens to strings before
  combining.
  
- Fixed bug in MatchFirst in which parse actions would be called for 
  expressions that only partially match. (Thanks, John Hunter!)
  
- Fixed bug in fourFn.py example that fixes right-associativity of ^ 
  operator. (Thanks, Andrea Griffini!)

- Added class FollowedBy(expression), to look ahead in the input string 
  without consuming tokens.

- Added class NoMatch that never matches any input. Can be useful in
  debugging, and in very specialized grammars.
  
- Added example pgn.py, for parsing chess game files stored in Portable
  Game Notation. (Thanks, Alberto Santini!)


Version 1.2.1 - August 19, 2004
-------------------------------
- Added SkipTo(expression) token type, simplifying grammars that only
  want to specify delimiting expressions, and want to match any characters
  between them.
  
- Added helper method dictOf(key,value), making it easier to work with
  the Dict class. (Inspired by Pavel Volkovitskiy, thanks!).

- Added optional argument listAllMatches (default=False) to 
  setResultsName().  Setting listAllMatches to True overrides the default
  modal setting of tokens to results names; instead, the results name
  acts as an accumulator for all matching tokens within the local 
  repetition group. (Suggested by Amaury Le Leyzour - thanks!)
  
- Fixed bug in ParseResults, throwing exception when trying to extract
  slice, or make a copy using [:]. (Thanks, Wilson Fowlie!)
  
- Fixed bug in transformString() when the input string contains <TAB>'s
  (Thanks, Rick Walia!).
  
- Fixed bug in returning tokens from un-Grouped And's, Or's and 
  MatchFirst's, where too many tokens would be included in the results, 
  confounding parse actions and returned results.
  
- Fixed bug in naming ParseResults returned by And's, Or's, and Match
  First's.

- Fixed bug in LineEnd() - matching this token now correctly consumes
  and returns the end of line "\n".
  
- Added a beautiful example for parsing Mozilla calendar files (Thanks, 
  Petri Savolainen!).

- Added support for dynamically modifying Forward expressions during
  parsing.


Version 1.2 - 20 June 2004
--------------------------
- Added definition for htmlComment to help support HTML scanning and
  parsing.
  
- Fixed bug in generating XML for Dict classes, in which trailing item was
  duplicated in the output XML.

- Fixed release bug in which scanExamples.py was omitted from release
  files.

- Fixed bug in transformString() when parse actions are not defined on the
  outermost parser element.

- Added example urlExtractor.py, as another example of using scanString
  and parse actions.
  

Version 1.2beta3 - 4 June 2004
------------------------------
- Added White() token type, analogous to Word, to match on whitespace
  characters.  Use White in parsers with significant whitespace (such as 
  configuration file parsers that use indentation to indicate grouping).  
  Construct White with a string containing the whitespace characters to be 
  matched.  Similar to Word, White also takes optional min, max, and exact 
  parameters. 

- As part of supporting whitespace-signficant parsing, added parseWithTabs() 
  method to ParserElement, to override the default behavior in parseString
  of automatically expanding tabs to spaces.  To retain tabs during
  parsing, call parseWithTabs() before calling parseString(), parseFile() or 
  scanString(). (Thanks, Jean-Guillaume Paradis for catching this, and for
  your suggestions on whitespace-significant parsing.)
  
- Added transformString() method to ParseElement, as a complement to 
  scanString().  To use transformString, define a grammar and attach a parse
  action to the overall grammar that modifies the returned token list.  
  Invoking transformString() on a target string will then scan for matches, 
  and replace the matched text patterns according to the logic in the parse 
  action.  transformString() returns the resulting transformed string.
  (Note: transformString() does *not* automatically expand tabs to spaces.)
  Also added scanExamples.py to the examples directory to show sample uses of
  scanString() and transformString().
  
- Removed group() method that was introduced in beta2.  This turns out NOT to
  be equivalent to nesting within a Group() object, and I'd prefer not to sow
  more seeds of confusion.
  
- Fixed behavior of asXML() where tags for groups were incorrectly duplicated.
  (Thanks, Brad Clements!)
  
- Changed beta version message to display to stderr instead of stdout, to 
  make asXML() easier to use.  (Thanks again, Brad.)


Version 1.2beta2 - 19 May 2004
------------------------------
- *** SIMPLIFIED API *** - Parse actions that do not modify the list of tokens
  no longer need to return a value.  This simplifies those parse actions that
  use the list of tokens to update a counter or record or display some of the
  token content; these parse actions can simply end without having to specify
  'return toks'.

- *** POSSIBLE API INCOMPATIBILITY *** - Fixed CaselessLiteral bug, where the 
  returned token text was not the original string (as stated in the docs), 
  but the original string converted to upper case.  (Thanks, Dang Griffith!)  
  **NOTE: this may break some code that relied on this erroneous behavior.
  Users should scan their code for uses of CaselessLiteral.**

- *** POSSIBLE CODE INCOMPATIBILITY *** - I have renamed the internal 
  attributes on ParseResults from 'dict' and 'list' to '__tokdict' and 
  '__toklist', to avoid collisions with user-defined data fields named 'dict'
  and 'list'.  Any client code that accesses these attributes directly will
  need to be modified.  Hopefully the implementation of methods such as keys(),
  items(), len(), etc. on ParseResults will make such direct attribute
  accessess unnecessary.
  
- Added asXML() method to ParseResults.  This greatly simplifies the process 
  of parsing an input data file and generating XML-structured data.

- Added getName() method to ParseResults.  This method is helpful when
  a grammar specifies ZeroOrMore or OneOrMore of a MatchFirst or Or
  expression, and the parsing code needs to know which expression matched.
  (Thanks, Eric van der Vlist, for this idea!)
  
- Added items() and values() methods to ParseResults, to better support using
  ParseResults as a Dictionary.

- Added parseFile() as a convenience function to parse the contents of an 
  entire text file.  Accepts either a file name or a file object.  (Thanks
  again, Dang!)

- Added group() method to And, Or, and MatchFirst, as a short-cut alternative
  to enclosing a construct inside a Group object.
  
- Extended fourFn.py to support exponentiation, and simple built-in functions.

- Added EBNF parser to examples, including a demo where it parses its own
  EBNF!  (Thanks to Seo Sanghyeon!)
  
- Added Delphi Form parser to examples, dfmparse.py, plus a couple of
  sample Delphi forms as tests.  (Well done, Dang!)

- Another performance speedup, 5-10%, inspired by Dang!  Plus about a 20%
  speedup, by pre-constructing and cacheing exception objects instead of 
  constructing them on the fly.

- Fixed minor bug when specifying oneOf() with 'caseless=True'.

- Cleaned up and added a few more docstrings, to improve the generated docs.


Version 1.1.2 - 21 Mar 2004
---------------------------
- Fixed minor bug in scanString(), so that start location is at the start of 
  the matched tokens, not at the start of the whitespace before the matched 
  tokens.

- Inclusion of HTML documentation, generated using Epydoc.  Reformatted some
  doc strings to better generate readable docs. (Beautiful work, Ed Loper,
  thanks for Epydoc!)

- Minor performance speedup, 5-15%

- And on a process note, I've used the unittest module to define a series of
  unit tests, to help avoid the embarrassment of the version 1.1 snafu.
  

Version 1.1.1 - 6 Mar 2004
--------------------------
- Fixed critical bug introduced in 1.1, which broke MatchFirst(!) token 
  matching.
  **THANK YOU, SEO SANGHYEON!!!**
  
- Added "from future import __generators__" to permit running under 
  pre-Python 2.3.

- Added example getNTPservers.py, showing how to use pyparsing to extract
  a text pattern from the HTML of a web page.
  
  
Version 1.1 - 3 Mar 2004
-------------------------
- ***Changed API*** - While testing out parse actions, I found that the value 
  of loc passed in was not the starting location of the matched tokens, but
  the location of the next token in the list.  With this version, the location
  passed to the parse action is now the starting location of the tokens that
  matched.
  
  A second part of this change is that the return value of parse actions no 
  longer needs to return a tuple containing both the location and the parsed
  tokens (which may optionally be modified); parse actions only need to return
  the list of tokens.  Parse actions that return a tuple are deprecated; they 
  will still work properly for conversion/compatibility, but this behavior will 
  be removed in a future version.
  
- Added validate() method, to help diagnose infinite recursion in a grammar tree.
  validate() is not 100% fool-proof, but it can help track down nasty infinite
  looping due to recursively referencing the same grammar construct without some 
  intervening characters.

- Cleaned up default listing of some parse element types, to more closely match
  ordinary BNF.  Instead of the form <classname>:[contents-list], some changes 
  are:
  . And(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 token2 token3 }"
  . Or(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 ^ token2 ^ token3 }"
  . MatchFirst(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 | token2 | token3 }"
  . Optional(token) is "[ token ]"
  . OneOrMore(token) is "{ token }..."
  . ZeroOrMore(token) is "[ token ]..."
  
- Fixed an infinite loop in oneOf if the input string contains a duplicated
  option. (Thanks Brad Clements)

- Fixed a bug when specifying a results name on an Optional token. (Thanks 
  again, Brad Clements)
  
- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.6 when I converted quotedString to use
  CharsNotIn; I accidentally permitted quoted strings to span newlines.  I have
  fixed this in this version to go back to the original behavior, in which
  quoted strings do *not* span newlines.

- Fixed minor bug in HTTP server log parser. (Thanks Jim Richardson)


Version 1.0.6 -  13 Feb 2004
----------------------------
- Added CharsNotIn class (Thanks, Lee SangYeong).  This is the opposite of 
  Word, in that it is constructed with a set of characters *not* to be matched.
  (This enhancement also allowed me to clean up and simplify some of the
  definitions for quoted strings, cStyleComment, and restOfLine.)
  
- **MINOR API CHANGE** - Added joinString argument to the __init__ method of 
  Combine (Thanks, Thomas Kalka).  joinString defaults to "", but some 
  applications might choose some other string to use instead, such as a blank 
  or newline.  joinString was inserted as the second argument to __init__,
  so if you have code that specifies an adjacent value, without using
  'adjacent=', this code will break.

- Modified LineStart to recognize the start of an empty line.

- Added optional caseless flag to oneOf(), to create a list of CaselessLiteral
  tokens instead of Literal tokens.

- Added some enhancements to the SQL example:
  . Oracle-style comments (Thanks to Harald Armin Massa)
  . simple WHERE clause

- Minor performance speedup - 5-15%


Version 1.0.5 -  19 Jan 2004
----------------------------
- Added scanString() generator method to ParseElement, to support regex-like
  pattern-searching

- Added items() list to ParseResults, to return named results as a 
  list of (key,value) pairs
  
- Fixed memory overflow in asList() for deeply nested ParseResults (Thanks,
  Sverrir Valgeirsson)

- Minor performance speedup - 10-15%


Version 1.0.4 -  8 Jan 2004
---------------------------
- Added positional tokens StringStart, StringEnd, LineStart, and LineEnd

- Added commaSeparatedList to pre-defined global token definitions; also added 
  commasep.py to the examples directory, to demonstrate the differences between 
  parsing comma-separated data and simple line-splitting at commas

- Minor API change: delimitedList does not automatically enclose the
  list elements in a Group, but makes this the responsibility of the caller;
  also, if invoked using 'combine=True', the list delimiters are also included
  in the returned text (good for scoped variables, such as a.b.c or a::b::c, or
  for directory paths such as a/b/c)
  
- Performance speed-up again, 30-40%

- Added httpServerLogParser.py to examples directory, as this is
  a common parsing task
  

Version 1.0.3 - 23 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Performance speed-up again, 20-40%

- Added Python distutils installation setup.py, etc. (thanks, Dave Kuhlman)


Version 1.0.2 - 18 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE: Changed API again!!!** (for the last time, I hope)
  
  + Renamed module from parsing to pyparsing, to better reflect Python
    linkage.

- Also added dictExample.py to examples directory, to illustrate
  usage of the Dict class.


Version 1.0.1 - 17 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE:  Changed API!**
  
  + Renamed 'len' argument on Word.__init__() to 'exact'

- Performance speed-up, 10-30%


Version 1.0.0 - 15 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Initial public release

Version 0.1.1 thru 0.1.17 - October-November, 2003
--------------------------------------------------
- initial development iterations:
    - added Dict, Group
    - added helper methods oneOf, delimitedList
    - added helpers quotedString (and double and single), restOfLine, cStyleComment
    - added MatchFirst as an alternative to the slower Or
    - added UML class diagram
    - fixed various logic bugs
