Change Log
==========

Version 1.0.6 -  13 Feb 2004
----------------------------
- Added NotInChars class (Thanks, Lee SangYeong).  This is the opposite of 
  Word, in that it is constructed with a set of characters *not* to be matched.
  (This enhancement also allowed me to clean up and simplify some of the
  definitions for quoted strings, cStyleComment, and restOfLine.)
  
- **MINOR API CHANGE** - Added joinString argument to the __init__ method of 
  Combine (Thanks, Thomas Kalka).  joinString defaults to "", but some 
  applications might choose some other string to use instead, such as a blank 
  or newline.  joinString was inserted as the second argument to __init__,
  so if you have code that specifies an adjacent value, without using
  'adjacent=', this code will break.

- Modified LineStart to recognize the start of an empty line.

- Added optional caseless flag to oneOf(), to create a list of CaselessLiteral
  tokens instead of Literal tokens.

- Added some enhancements to the SQL example:
  . Oracle-style comments (Thanks to Harald Armin Massa)
  . simple WHERE clause

- Minor performance speedup - 5-15%


Version 1.0.5 -  19 Jan 2004
---------------------------
- Added scanString() generator method to ParseElement, to support regex-like
  pattern-searching

- Added items() list to ParseResults, to return named results as a 
  list of (key,value) pairs
  
- Fixed memory overflow in asList() for deeply nested ParseResults

- Minor performance speedup - 10-15%


Version 1.0.4 -  8 Jan 2004
---------------------------
- Added positional tokens StringStart, StringEnd, LineStart, and LineEnd

- Added commaSeparatedList to pre-defined global token definitions; also added 
  commasep.py to the examples directory, to demonstrate the differences between 
  parsing comma-separated data and simple line-splitting at commas

- Minor API change: delimitedList does not automatically enclose the
  list elements in a Group, but makes this the responsibility of the caller;
  also, if invoked using 'combine=True', the list delimiters are also included
  in the returned text (good for scoped variables, such as a.b.c or a::b::c, or
  for directory paths such as a/b/c)
  
- Performance speed-up again, 30-40%

- Added httpServerLogParser.py to examples directory, as this is
  a common parsing task
  

Version 1.0.3 - 23 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Performance speed-up again, 20-40%

- Added Python distutils installation setup.py, etc. (thanks, Dave Kuhlman)


Version 1.0.2 - 18 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE: Changed API again!!!** (for the last time, I hope)
  
  + Renamed module from parsing to pyparsing, to better reflect Python
    linkage.

- Also added dictExample.py to examples directory, to illustrate
  usage of the Dict class.


Version 1.0.1 - 17 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- **NOTE:  Changed API!**
  
  + Renamed 'len' argument on Word.__init__() to 'exact'

- Performance speed-up, 10-30%


Version 1.0.0 - 15 Dec 2003
---------------------------
- Initial release

Version 0.1.1 thru 0.1.17 - October-November, 2003
--------------------------------------------------
- initial development iterations:
- added Dict, Group
- added helper methods oneOf, delimitedList
- added helpers quotedString (and double and single), restOfLine, cStyleComment
- added MatchFirst as an alternative to the slower Or
- added UML class diagram
- fixed various logic bugs
