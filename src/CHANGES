Change Log
==========

Version 1.0.4 -  8 Jan 2004
---------------------------
- Added positional tokens StringStart, StringEnd, LineStart, and LineEnd

- Added commaSeparatedList to pre-defined global token definitions; also added 
  commasep.py to the examples directory, to demonstrate the differences between 
  parsing comma-separated data and simple line-splitting at commas

- Minor API change: delimitedList does not automatically enclose the
  list elements in a Group, but makes this the responsibility of the caller;
  also, if invoked using 'combine=True', the list delimiters are also included
  in the returned text (good for scoped variables, such as a.b.c or a::b::c, or
  for directory paths such as a/b/c)
  
- Performance speed-up again, 30-40%

- Added httpServerLogParser.py to examples directory, as this is
  a common parsing task
